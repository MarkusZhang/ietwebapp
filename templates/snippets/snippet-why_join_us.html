        <p>The IET supports the professional development (PD) of people working in the fields of engineering and technology - to raise the standards and recognition of those professions. It centres around competences: the recognised knowledge, skills and attributes needed to deliver results in your chosen field. It keeps you fresh and at the leading edge of your profession.
Structuring your professional development will help you maintain these high levels of professional competences by continually developing your knowledge and skills. The IET provides the tools to help you get started with your own PD programme, build a plan using competence frameworks, plan your journey towards professional registration, and point you towards the resources that will help you on your way. </p>
    <p>Career Manager is the IETâ€™s online skills development and recording tool. Career and personal development is made easier through skill profiling against recognised competence frameworks, and using one central place to collate all your career information, achievements and experience. You can also prepare and submit your application for professional registration online using Career Manager. </p>
